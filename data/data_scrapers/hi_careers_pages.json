Graduate school is crucial for certain careers in the Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resources industry, as it provides advanced knowledge, research skills, and specialized training that are essential for leadership roles and technical positions. For careers in agricultural research, environmental policy, food science, and natural resource management, a graduate degree can deepen expertise in areas like sustainable practices, biotechnologies, and ecosystem management. This level of education also opens doors to academic and research positions, high-level consultancy, and roles in governmental and international organizations, where advanced qualifications are often required to influence policy, drive innovation, and address complex challenges in the industry. For students considering applying to graduate school, here are five important factors to consider: Career Goals: Determine whether a graduate degree is necessary for your desired career path. Some careers in fields like academia, research, or specialized industry roles require advanced degrees, while others may not. Field of Study: Consider what specific area or discipline you want to focus on in graduate school. Graduate programs are highly specialized, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to have a clear understanding of your academic and professional interests. Program Requirements: Research the prerequisites for the graduate programs you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in, including required coursework, standardized tests (like the GRE), and any relevant work or research experience. Make sure you meet these requirements or have a plan to do so. Financing: Think about how you will finance your graduate education. Consider tuition costs, availability of scholarships, assistantships, or grants, and whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to take out loans. Weigh the potential return on investment of a graduate degree in your field. Research potential scholarship opportunities. Time Commitment: Understand the time commitment involved in graduate school. Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s programs typically take 1-3 years, while doctoral programs can take 4-7 years or more. Consider how this fits into your long-term personal and professional plans.

Graduate school is crucial for certain careers in the Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resources industry, as it provides advanced knowledge, research skills, and specialized training that are essential for leadership roles and technical positions. For careers in agricultural research, environmental policy, food science, and natural resource management, a graduate degree can deepen expertise in areas like sustainable practices, biotechnologies, and ecosystem management. This level of education also opens doors to academic and research positions, high-level consultancy, and roles in governmental and international organizations, where advanced qualifications are often required to influence policy, drive innovation, and address complex challenges in the industry. For students considering applying to graduate school, here are five important factors to consider: Career Goals: Determine whether a graduate degree is necessary for your desired career path. Some careers in fields like academia, research, or specialized industry roles require advanced degrees, while others may not. Field of Study: Consider what specific area or discipline you want to focus on in graduate school. Graduate programs are highly specialized, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to have a clear understanding of your academic and professional interests. Program Requirements: Research the prerequisites for the graduate programs you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in, including required coursework, standardized tests (like the GRE), and any relevant work or research experience. Make sure you meet these requirements or have a plan to do so. Financing: Think about how you will finance your graduate education. Consider tuition costs, availability of scholarships, assistantships, or grants, and whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to take out loans. Weigh the potential return on investment of a graduate degree in your field. Research potential scholarship opportunities. Time Commitment: Understand the time commitment involved in graduate school. Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s programs typically take 1-3 years, while doctoral programs can take 4-7 years or more. Consider how this fits into your long-term personal and professional plans.

Graduate school is crucial for certain careers in the Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resources industry, as it provides advanced knowledge, research skills, and specialized training that are essential for leadership roles and technical positions. For careers in agricultural research, environmental policy, food science, and natural resource management, a graduate degree can deepen expertise in areas like sustainable practices, biotechnologies, and ecosystem management. This level of education also opens doors to academic and research positions, high-level consultancy, and roles in governmental and international organizations, where advanced qualifications are often required to influence policy, drive innovation, and address complex challenges in the industry. For students considering applying to graduate school, here are five important factors to consider: Career Goals: Determine whether a graduate degree is necessary for your desired career path. Some careers in fields like academia, research, or specialized industry roles require advanced degrees, while others may not. Field of Study: Consider what specific area or discipline you want to focus on in graduate school. Graduate programs are highly specialized, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to have a clear understanding of your academic and professional interests. Program Requirements: Research the prerequisites for the graduate programs you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in, including required coursework, standardized tests (like the GRE), and any relevant work or research experience. Make sure you meet these requirements or have a plan to do so. Financing: Think about how you will finance your graduate education. Consider tuition costs, availability of scholarships, assistantships, or grants, and whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to take out loans. Weigh the potential return on investment of a graduate degree in your field. Research potential scholarship opportunities. Time Commitment: Understand the time commitment involved in graduate school. Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s programs typically take 1-3 years, while doctoral programs can take 4-7 years or more. Consider how this fits into your long-term personal and professional plans.

The interdisciplinary fields of environmental science and environmental studies are both dedicated to the study of these critical problems with the aim of identifying feasible solutions. Environmental Science focuses on the study of natural systems and the application of technology to protect and improve the environment while Environmental Studies focuses on the interaction between human and natural systems and the connection between science and policy. Environmental and sustainability issues are overarching and complex; addressing these challenges requires a unique set of skills. Because of this, both majors utilize an interdisciplinary approach toward critical analysis and problem-solving while providing students with experience in the use of a wide range of tools. Students from both majors work together in many of the same upper division courses to foster respect for diverse perspectives and abilities and to build skills for working effectively within interdisciplinary teams. Which path is for me? Environmental Science (B.S.) The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) major is designed for those students with an interest in the more technical aspects of environmental systems. Students take a series of rigorous courses in chemistry, physics, biology, earth systems science, and mathematics. Upper level B.S. students can choose to follow a general environmental science track or complement their environmental science courses with a biology or chemistry concentration. Environmental Studies (B.A.) The Bachelor of Art (B.A.) major is designed for students with an interest in the policy and management aspects of environmental and sustainability issues. Coursework includes a foundation in environmental science. Students build upon that foundation with courses in economics, policy, communication, management, and ethics to gain a breadth of perspective for examining environmental and sustainability issues.

Marine Biology: The study of life in the oceans - from microscopic plankton to the largest animals on earth, the blue whales. Like biology, marine biology has many, diverse fields of study contained within it including the study of the molecules within cells (molecular biology), the functions and adaptations of organisms (physiology), and populations of organisms and their interactions with each other and their environment (ecology). What unites these areas as marine biology is the saltwater environment, whether it be the coastal wetlands and estuaries, rocky shorelines and beaches, coral reefs and kelp forests, or the vast open-ocean habitat and abyssal sea. This biology draws on other sciences such as chemistry, physics, geology, and oceanography, and includes disciplines such as marine microbiology, phycology (the study of algae), marine toxicology, fisheries and aquaculture, deep-sea ecology, invertebrate zoology, ichthyology (the study of fish), marine mammalogy, and marine conservation biology. B.A. Marine Affairs: The Ocean needs scientific study, but it also needs skilled advocates trained in marine science to effect change in policy, law, business, and communications. The Bachelor of Arts in Marine Affairs is an interdisciplinary marine science degree that focuses on the fundamentals of marine science, the nature of the changing systems, sustainability of ocean resources, and social and environmental justice. Marine Affairs professionals are well prepared to advocate, educate, communicate, and liaise between the existing marine resource problems and the solutions that society can implement. Students in this major will be prepared to contribute to ocean advocacy in professional positions and/or could pursue advanced degrees in science, administration, policy, resource management, and/or law. Students further refine their career paths by selecting a minor in business, criminal justice, management, public administration, strategic communication, or sustainability. This program requires a research practicum or internship related to the student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desired specialization. B.S. Oceanography: Oceanography is the interdisciplinary study of the global oceans -- from shallow coastal areas to the deepest ocean trenches, from the tropics to the polar seas. It is usually divided into four sub-disciplines: Physical Oceanography \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the study of waves, currents, tides, and ocean energy. Geological Oceanography \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the study of the sediments, rocks, and structure of the seafloor and coastal margins. Chemical Oceanography \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the study of the composition and properties of seawater and how it is affected by physical mixing processes and interactions with the seafloor, the atmosphere, and ocean life. Biological Oceanography \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the study of marine organisms and their interactions with the ocean environment. All of these sub-disciplines are highly interrelated, as well as being closely aligned to other fields such as meteorology/atmospheric science, geophysics, and ocean engineering. As you might expect, biological oceanography shares many aspects with marine biology, but is generally more focused on the interactions of specific parameters within the marine environment -- paying particular attention to the affects of chemical, physical, or geographic properties of the ocean -- and marine organism distribution and/or the patterns of biological populations in the sea. HPU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oceanography program includes all of the sub-disciplines of oceanography.

Students learn to embody altruistic values in professional practice and experience first-hand how design can contribute to a more just society. They are also involved with a \u00e2\u0080\u0098live\u00e2\u0080\u0099 project in which they see their design proposals realized and accrue invaluable experience interacting with real clients and challenging constraints. E+ID Student Experiences \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Design projects are geared towards providing a platform for students to apply what they have learned in their courses to solve real design problems. Freedom to explore in a safe environment fosters the ability to be open-minded; to engage in the iterative process of design; and to discover valuable lessons from mistakes and successes. Ultimately, a competent, confident, collaborative, teachable, skillful designer emerges. Students are encouraged to be creative and imaginative, while not losing sight of the need to develop practical, viable, cost-effective solutions. As part of the design process, students explore both abstract and theoretical ideas in conjunction with pragmatic considerations. Internships \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a requirement of the E+ID program, internships provide students with opportunities to explore the numerous and varied opportunities that a degree in design affords them. Guided by faculty and connected with industry professionals, students may intern for small to large architecture or interior design firms; contractors; lighting designers; furniture vendors/manufacturers; architectural finish vendors; theatrical, television or movie performance agencies; historic preservation agencies \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the list is quite endless!

Some of those certifications can be done while you are in high school or shortly after graduation. Here are a few reasons why obtaining one or more of theses certifications would help you on your path to working in the education field: Enhanced Knowledge and Skills : Entry-level certifications and training provide you with foundational knowledge and skills related to education. This can give you a head start in understanding basic concepts and pedagogy, making it easier to grasp more advanced teaching concepts during your studies. Practical Experience : Entry-level certifications and training can provide you with exposure to classroom settings, allowing you to become familiar with the different teaching environments, and understanding age and grade level teaching preferences. Professional Capacity Building Opportunities : Obtaining entry-level certifications and training can help you build connections and peer relationships with teachers and administrators. Capacity building within the education field will allow you to enhance and develop your knowledge, skills and stay updated on new pedagogical approaches, technologies, and curriculum changes in local schools systems. Improved Employability : Possessing entry-level certification and training can make you more competitive in the job market and increase your chances of finding employment as a teacher in the location, grade level and content area of your choice. Entry Level Training Programs: Entry-level training for careers in education can vary depending on the specific role and grade level you want to teach. Here are some common entry-level training options for careers in education: Basic Life Support (BLS) Certification : High school students can pursue BLS certification, which teaches cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) skills. BLS certification is often required for education professionals. Range of program duration: 2 - 4 hours Mental Health Technician : Mental health is just as important as physical health when it comes to a person's overall well-being. Mental health technicians care for patients with mental or emotional conditions or disabilities. Acting under a health practitioner's order, technicians monitor a patient's physical and emotional health; observe and sometimes interact, teach, counsel, or support the patient; restrain patients when needed; and assist patients with their daily tasks such as bathing and cleaning. Range of program duration: 1 to 2 semesters Registered Behavior Technician : Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) training prepares participants to meet all criteria to be eligible to become a nationally recognized RBT, a paraprofessional certified in behavior analysis. RBTs assist in delivering behavior-analytic services and practice under the direction and close supervision of an RBT Supervisor and/or an RBT Requirements Coordinator, who are responsible for all work RBTs perform. RBT certification was originally designed for settings in which a BCBA or BCaBA is already providing behavior-analytic services. Thus, applying to become an RBT is most likely to occur after the applicant has been employed by the organization in which they will continue their work assisting qualified BCBAs and/or BCaBAs in their service-delivery activities. This course includes a job shadowing experience during the last two weeks.

These programs often focus on building specialized knowledge and skills, which can be acquired regardless of the student's undergraduate field. Foundation and Prerequisite Courses: Graduate programs sometimes offer foundational or prerequisite courses to bridge any gaps in knowledge. This allows students without specific undergraduate training to catch up on necessary concepts early in their master's program. Holistic Admissions Criteria: Admissions committees consider a range of factors beyond the undergraduate major, such as work experience, letters of recommendation, personal statements, and standardized test scores (like the GRE or GMAT). This holistic approach recognizes that a student's potential and aptitude for the graduate program can be demonstrated through various means. Skill Transferability: Many skills acquired in one discipline are transferable to another. Critical thinking, research, writing, and problem-solving are examples of skills that are valuable across many fields of study. Thus, students from diverse academic backgrounds can succeed in graduate programs that value these skills. Program-Specific Requirements: While some master's programs have specific prerequisites, many do not. Programs that do have prerequisites might allow students to complete these requirements during the early stages of the master's program or through additional coursework.

Social workers are employed in a variety of settings such as hospitals, schools, the legislature, and social welfare agencies that address the needs of children, adults, and elders. Wherever they find themselves, social workers use their skills to empower others to help themselves and change unresponsive social systems.

Speaking to a packed hall, Pierson said that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seen plenty of educational reforms in her 40 years as a teacher. But, she said, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rarely talked about in education is the value of making connections\u00e2\u0080\u0094of positive relationship-building. Young people, Pierson said, need people in their lives who will encourage them when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making progress, applaud them when they succeed, and remember how tough it was to be a kid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery child deserves a champion, an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pierson said, adding, with a wide smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re educators. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re born to make a difference.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with her more. Teachers make a positive difference in young people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives every single day, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s especially true in secondary education. Need proof? Just think back on how important your positive relationships with teachers were when you were in middle and high school. Think back on that high school literature teacher who made Shakespeare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s works come alive or that seventh-grade pre-algebra teacher who wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happy until you understood a concept fully. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lie. Teaching is not easy, especially at the secondary level. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have good days, some not-so-good days and a few tough days. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here to give you the educational foundation you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to succeed, creating learning environments that will help students thrive. Once you complete the Secondary Education program , you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be licensed to teach grades 7 through 12 in your core content area (English, Mathematics, Science or Social Studies) in Hawaii and most other states. The best part: your coursework can be completed online, giving you extra flexibility while you gear up for student teaching opportunities in your area.

Here are a few reasons why obtaining one or more of theses certifications would help you on your path to working in the health field: Enhanced Knowledge and Skills: Entry-level certifications provide you with foundational knowledge and skills related to healthcare and patient care. This can give you a head start in understanding basic concepts and procedures, making it easier to grasp more advanced nursing concepts during your studies. Competitive Advantage: Health programs can be competitive, with limited spots available. Having entry-level certifications can set you apart from other applicants by demonstrating your commitment to the healthcare field and your readiness to contribute to patient care. It shows that you have taken the initiative to acquire relevant skills and experience, making you a more attractive candidate. Practical Experience: Entry-level certifications can provide you with exposure to real healthcare settings, allowing you to become familiar with the clinical environment, patient interactions, and healthcare team dynamics. Networking Opportunities: Obtaining entry-level certifications can help you build connections with healthcare professionals, instructors, and potential employers. Networking within the healthcare field will allow you to have a greater understanding of careers in healthcare through these connections. Improved Employability: Possessing entry-level certification can make you more competitive in the job market and increase your chances of finding employment as a healthcare professional. Entry Level Training Programs: Entry-level training for Human Performance Therapeutic Services-related careers can vary depending on the specific role and level of education required. Here are some common entry-level training options for nursing-related careers: Basic Life Support (BLS) Certification: High school students can pursue BLS certification, which teaches cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) skills. BLS certification is often required for healthcare professionals, including nurses. Range of program duration: 2 - 4 hours Community Health Worker: Community Health Worker (CHW), also known as a Community Health Advocate, is a frontline public health worker who acts as a bridge between healthcare and social services and the communities they serve. Community Health Workers are essential in addressing health disparities, improving access to healthcare, and promoting health equity, especially in underserved and marginalized communities. Their work is crucial in bridging gaps in healthcare delivery and helping individuals and communities achieve better health outcomes. The specific roles and responsibilities of CHWs may vary depending on the community's needs and the healthcare system they work within. Range of program duration: 6 months to 1 year Medical Assistant: Medical assisting is a healthcare profession that combines administrative and clinical duties to support the efficient operation of medical offices, clinics, and healthcare facilities. Medical assistants work closely with physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to ensure the smooth delivery of patient care.  Medical assistants typically complete a post-secondary education program, which can lead to a diploma, certificate, or associate's degree in medical assisting.  The specific program you choose may depend on your career goals, educational background, and the time you can commit to training. Range of program duration: 70-800 hours Medical Reimbursement Specialist: This is a healthcare professional responsible for ensuring that medical services provided to patients are accurately coded, billed, and reimbursed by insurance companies or other third-party payers. Their role is crucial for healthcare providers and facilities to receive proper compensation for the services they offer. Range of program duration: 80-85 hours Medical Receptionist and Patient Services: The Medical Receptionist and Patient Services program provides participants with a foundational understanding of the healthcare delivery system, the role of the PSR, and the tools needed to be a front-line customer-service agent in a medical office or hospital setting. Responsibilities include (but are not limited to): written and verbal correspondence with patients, scheduling, collecting co-payments, maintaining patient charts, verifying insurance coverage, and ensuring overall patient satisfaction. This course consists of five modules tailored to those with little or no experience, looking to begin a career in healthcare. Range of program duration: 80-85 hours Mental Health Technician: Mental health is just as important as physical health when it comes to a person's overall well-being. Mental health technicians care for patients with mental or emotional conditions or disabilities. Acting under a health practitioner's order, technicians monitor a patient's physical and emotional health; observe and sometimes interact, teach, counsel, or support the patient; restrain patients when needed; and assist patients with their daily tasks such as bathing and cleaning. Range of program duration: 1 to 2 semesters Registered Behavior Technician: Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) training prepares participants to meet all criteria to be eligible to become a nationally recognized RBT, a paraprofessional certified in behavior analysis. RBTs assist in delivering behavior-analytic services and practice under the direction and close supervision of an RBT Supervisor and/or an RBT Requirements Coordinator, who are responsible for all work RBTs perform. RBT certification was originally designed for settings in which a BCBA or BCaBA is already providing behavior-analytic services. Thus, applying to become an RBT is most likely to occur after the applicant has been employed by the organization in which they will continue their work assisting qualified BCBAs and/or BCaBAs in their service-delivery activities. This course includes a job shadowing experience during the last two weeks.

Take a look at Good Jobs Hawai\u00e2\u0080\u0098i There are several benefits to obtaining entry-level training programs or certifications before starting nursing school. Some of those certifications can be done while you are in high school or shortly after graduation. Here are a few reasons why obtaining one or more of theses certifications would help you on your path to become registered nurse: Enhanced Knowledge and Skills: Entry-level certifications provide you with foundational knowledge and skills related to healthcare and patient care. This can give you a head start in understanding basic concepts and procedures, making it easier to grasp more advanced nursing concepts during your studies. Competitive Advantage: Nursing programs are competitive, with limited spots available. Having entry-level certifications can set you apart from other applicants by demonstrating your commitment to the healthcare field and your readiness to contribute to patient care. It shows that you have taken the initiative to acquire relevant skills and experience, making you a more attractive candidate. Practical Experience: Entry-level certifications can provide you with exposure to real healthcare settings, allowing you to become familiar with the clinical environment, patient interactions, and healthcare team dynamics. This can help ease the transition from classroom learning to clinical practice during nursing school. Networking Opportunities: Obtaining entry-level certifications can help you build connections with healthcare professionals, instructors, and potential employers. Networking within the healthcare field will allow you to have a greater understanding of careers in healthcare through these connections. Improved Employability: Possessing entry-level certification can make you more competitive in the job market and increase your chances of finding employment as a nurse. Many healthcare facilities value nurses with diverse skills, such as phlebotomy, as it allows for flexibility and versatility in patient care settings.

The civil engineer conceives, plans, designs, constructs, operates, and maintains buildings, bridges, highways, airports, railways, tunnels, waterways ports and harbors, dams, water supply and wastewater treatment systems, and earthworks. Important considerations of the civil engineer in providing infrastructure and buildings is improved health and safety for people, minimized impact to the environment, sensitivity to costs and resources, and overall sustainability. Civil engineering continuously improves its methods and each new or upgraded component improves the standard of living for large populations. The cities we live in and most of their vital infrastructure are the creation of civil engineers. Our undergraduate program, leading to the Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Degree (B.S.C.E.) , is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org . The current enrollment and graduate rates can be found at http://www.eng.hawaii.edu/about/degreesawarded/ . The B.S.C.E. degree requires at least 126 credit hours of course work and it is designed to be completed in eight semesters. The curriculum provides a broad-based background of fundamentals, including humanities and social sciences, basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering design. Course requirements also include 61 credit hours of civil and environmental engineering courses from the following areas: applied mechanics, structural analysis and design, hydraulics, surveying, transportation, construction, soil mechanics, hydrology, water resources, and environmental engineering. During the senior year, students either follow a general CE track, or they may choose to follow a specialized track (not minor), which allows a certain degree of specialization in the areas of structural or environmental engineering. The undergraduate experience culminates in a senior capstone course in which students apply the knowledge they have gained throughout their undergraduate coursework toward the design of a comprehensive project. There are three basic components to the undergraduate program: The University-wide General Education Core and Graduation requirements, which are usually substantially completed during the first two years of the University experience. The College of Engineering requirements; and, The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering requirements. These are discussed below. Courses to be taken for the B.S.C.E. program, which satisfy the above requirements, are listed in the Curriculum Check Sheet .

Slide 1: Title
    • UH Pathfinder
    • Personalized Career Pathways for Hawaiʻi Students
    • Team: Logimoca | Challenge: Education / Workforce Development

Slide 2: Problem (Why Now)
    • Guidance Gap: 300+ UH programs; students can’t translate interests to local training.
    • Data Disconnect: Program descriptions and O*NET occupations are isolated – no direct “Program → Job” map.
    • Local Talent Leakage: Unclear pathways contribute to out‑migration; opportunity to retain skilled youth.
    • Cost of Mid-Stream Pivots: Late major changes increase time & tuition; early clarity reduces backtracking.

    Users & Pain Points
    • Potential Students: High school seniors & career changers need fast, confidence-building direction.
    • Existing Students: Considering a pivot; want low-friction validation before changing majors.
    • Working Adults: Seek upskilling without sifting through entire catalogs.
    • Shared Pain: Manual catalog browsing + inconsistent counselor availability.

Slide 3: Core Solution
    • Interest → Occupation: 30-question RIASEC → balanced, bias‑corrected occupation ranking.
    • Occupation → Program: Our offline semantic linker ties UH programs to O*NET codes (durable data asset).
    • Skill Refinement: Task-based skill confirmation (low friction, evidence-based) + optional narrative.
    • Local Relevance Filter: Only show careers with actual Hawaiʻi training routes.
    • Conversational Guidance: Progressive Q&A narrows pathways; logs questions for insight.
    • Voice & Multilingual (Roadmap): Speech and translation layers to broaden accessibility.

    Differentiators (Why Us)
    • Hyper-Local Focus: Built for Hawaiʻi; not generic national portals.
    • Two-Stage Data Bridge: Durable semantic program→occupation mapping + real-time vector retrieval.
    • Frictionless UX: No 40-skill rating fatigue; experiential task selection instead.
    • Resilient Architecture: Graceful fallback demo mode; production-ready service pattern.
    • Baseline Comparison: Extends Google Career Dreamer concept with direct UH pathway links & pivot risk reduction.

Slide 5: Impact (Early & Future)
Immediate:
• Cuts decision paralysis; faster program alignment.
• Shows “there IS a path here” → retention lever.
Near-Term:

Slide 10: Closing
• UH Pathfinder turns static program lists into personalized, local career journeys.
• Retain talent. Clarify choices. Accelerate preparedness.
• Ready for a focused pilot – let’s build Hawaiʻi’s next workforce, here.

Pitch Emphasis Tips:
1. Open With Tension: One student, three interests, zero clarity – then show instant pathway.
2. Show Live Demo Early (<60s): Interest code → top occupation → linked UH program card.
3. Quantify Simplicity: “30 questions → 3 letters → curated local pathways.”
4. Highlight Local Uniqueness: Emphasize UH program linking (not generic national tool).
5. Underscore Durability: Offline semantic mapping = reusable asset, not one-off scripts.
6. Keep Metrics Lightweight: Potential KPIs—time to first viable program, % students selecting in-state pathway.
7. De-Risk Narrative: Fallback mode ensures demo works even if backend hiccups.
8. Finish With Stakeholder Value: Counselors save time; students gain confidence; community retains talent.

Delivery Tips:
• Use a single compelling example persona throughout.
• Avoid jargon: define RIASEC once, move on.
• Keep slides sparse: speak the story; let visuals carry detail.
• Anticipate question: “How accurate are matches?” → Explain balanced scoring & transparent formula.
• Have a clear “ask”: Pilot access + data collaboration.

Q&A Ready Answers:
• Data Freshness: Program linkage refresh batch quarterly.
• Expansion: Swap program corpus; keep occupation + skill core.
• Privacy: No storing of sensitive PII; assessment ephemeral.

========================
Time-Constrained Delivery (2 + 2 + 2 Framework)
========================

Condensed Slide Grouping for 2-Min Pitch (Recommend showing only 5 core visuals):
1. Title + Tagline (5s) – UH Pathfinder | Local Career Pathways
2. Problem + Users (25s) – Guidance gap, pivot cost, who hurts today.
3. Solution + Differentiators (40s) – Interest→Occupation→Program chain, conversational AI, local data bridge, comparison to Career Dreamer.
4. Impact + Metrics (30s) – Retention lever, early clarity, pilot KPIs.
5. Call to Action (20s) – Pilot sites + instrumentation ask.

Suggested Visual Adjustments:
• Merge slides 2 + 2a; merge 3 + 4; combine 5 + 5a.
• Keep only one impact graphic (pathway funnel) + one architecture diagram.
• Remove deep roadmap & ethics slides from spoken pitch (leave in appendix if needed for Q&A).

========================
2-Min Pitch Script (≈120s)
========================
00–05s: "We’re UH Pathfinder—turning Hawaiʻi’s program catalog into personalized local career journeys."
05–30s: "Today a high school senior faces 300+ UH programs and generic online career tools. Guidance depends on who is available; late major changes inflate tuition and time. Working adults and pivoting students browse PDFs or ask friends. Hawaiʻi loses talent when students can’t see a clear in-state path." 
30–70s: "Pathfinder runs a 30‑question RIASEC to anchor interests, ranks occupations with a transparent composite, then—our differentiator—links each occupation directly to UH programs via an offline semantic mapping layer. A conversational refinement loop asks simple experience-based prompts, not 40 checkbox skill ratings. We filter for local relevance only, extending beyond Google Career Dreamer by showing the actual training pathway on island. Architecture: durable program→occupation bridge + real-time vector retrieval + graceful offline fallback." 
70–100s: "Immediate impact: cuts decision paralysis, reduces pivot risk, shows ‘there IS a path here’—a retention lever. Pilot metrics: utilization %, median time to first viable pathway, pathway confidence score, reduction in mid-program pivots, question log depth. Data exhaust becomes planning insight for UH." 
100–120s: "Ask: Pilot at 1–2 high schools and one community college advising center with instrumentation enabled. We’ll validate clarity uplift and guidance efficiency, then layer voice and multilingual access. Let’s retain talent by making local pathways obvious." 

========================
2-Min Demo Flow (≈120s)
========================
00–10s: Show landing screen (persona: Kai, senior interested in tech & sustainability).
10–35s: Complete final RIASEC answer → reveal interest code & top matched occupations (point to transparent percentage badge).
35–55s: Click one occupation (e.g., Environmental Engineering Technician) → show linked UH programs card(s).
55–75s: Open conversational refinement: user states experience ("Built a solar microgrid in STEM club") → skill context updates; occupation ordering slight shift.
75–95s: Show skill gap suggestion: two courses at Leeward CC to close readiness delta.
95–110s: Perform natural language query: "Where can I study marine robotics on Maui?" → vector retrieval returns relevant program snippet.
110–120s: Close with call-to-action button ("Request Pilot" / link) + instrumentation note.

Demo Tips:
• Preload persona answers for speed (skip slow typing).
• Keep transitions snappy; no scrolling through long lists.
• Avoid feature detours (roadmap items) until Q&A.

========================
Judge Q&A Cheat Sheet (Target ≤ 2 Min Total)
========================
Scoring Transparency: "Composite = interest alignment + local pathway presence + experiential skill bump; weights documented—no black box."
Accuracy Validation: "Pilot logs chosen pathways vs subsequent enroll intent; iterate using misalignment cases."
Data Freshness: "Program mapping batch refresh quarterly; incremental diff possible if catalogs change."
Privacy & Ethics: "Session-based; we don’t store sensitive PII—only anonymized interaction metrics."
Multilingual/Voice: "Add ASR + translation layer—architecture already modular; no retraining of mapping."
Scaling Beyond Hawaiʻi: "Swap program corpus; keep occupation core and mapping workflow."
Fallback Mode: "If vector or LLM unavailable, deterministic occupation ranking & static program links still render."
Cost Control: "Primary cost front-loaded in mapping; runtime lookups are low-latency Postgres + vector index."
Competitive Edge: "Local specificity + durable semantic bridge vs generic national portals lacking training linkage."
Impact KPIs: "Pivot reduction % and clarity score improvement are our north stars for retention correlation."

Rapid Answer Patterns:
• If asked about bias: "Use balanced ranking; interest profile weights normalized; pathway presence prevents over-recommending non-local high-prestige roles."
• If asked about monetization: "Institutional license / counselor dashboard insights; student interface remains free to maximize adoption."
• If asked about expansion tech: "Mapping pipeline tokenizes program descriptions, embeds, clusters, human QA on outliers—repeatable anywhere."

========================
Time Box Reminders On Stage
========================
• Pitch: Aim slide transitions at ~25s, 70s, 100s marks.
• Demo: Keep each segment <20s; script fallback wording in case of latency.
• Q&A: Prioritize transparency, impact, feasibility; defer deep roadmaps.
